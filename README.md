# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis:

The overview of this project is to help V. Isualize and Omar to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data according to city type by using our Python Skills. We will then use Pandas and Matplotlip to create a multiple-line graph that will show total weekly fares for each city types. 

## Results:

According to the results, total of rides depends on the location. In the chart provided below, we can see that urban areas have major success because there's a lot of people. When we look at the numbers for the total rides, Rural has a total of 125 rides, Surburban has a total of 625 rides, and Urban has a total of 1625 rides. The chart also shows us that when the number of rides increases everything else increases such as the number of Total of Rides, Total of Drivers, Total of Fares, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Drives.

Once we look at the Line Graph below, it shows the success of each city type.
